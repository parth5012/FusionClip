# Execution Log

## 2026-09-23: Wayfinder Map #67 - Trust & Integrity Fixes

### Status: Done

### Changes & Verification:
- **Phase 1 (HITL): #78 - Decide which trust gaps ship in v1 and honest-labeling policy**
  - Interviewed operator and resolved all 4 trust gaps to ship in v1 (real embeddings, real tunnel endpoints, disable upscale button with tooltip, strict 400 task_type enum).
  - Recorded resolution on #78 and closed.
- **Phase 2 (AFK): #79 - Wire Settings tunnel form and header badge to backend**
  - Added `frontend/src/utils/tunnel.ts` normalizing settings intent and resolving against GET /api/colab/metrics with 10s-staleness rule.
  - Added API functions in `frontend/src/utils/api.ts`: `fetchTunnelSettings`, `configureColabTunnel`, and `fetchColabTunnelState`.
  - Updated `SettingsPanel.tsx` to read from/write to backend via POST /api/colab/tunnel and GET /api/colab/metrics.
  - Updated `Header.tsx` to poll backend tunnel state so the badge reflects real connectivity.
  - Updated `useStore.ts` with v2 schema migration to exclude `colabTunnel` from localStorage partialize.
  - Added unit tests in `frontend/src/utils/tunnel.test.ts` (3 passed) and e2e integration tests in `04-settings-configuration.spec.ts`.
  - Verified: `bun test frontend/src/utils/tunnel.test.ts` (3 passed), `npx tsc --noEmit` (clean). Commit `ab72a63`.
- **Phase 2 (AFK): #80 - Replace fake embeddings with real MiniLM-L6-v2 + backfill**
  - Added `app/services/embedding.py` using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions) via fastembed/sentence-transformers with deterministic fallback.
  - Migrated `MediaAsset.embedding` from `Vector(1536)` to `Vector(384)` in `app/models.py` and created Alembic migration `a8d1e394f01c_migrate_embeddings_1536_to_384.py`.
  - Updated `search_media()` to compute real semantic query embeddings, order by native pgvector cosine distance on PostgreSQL, compute cosine distance ranking in Python on SQLite/non-pgvector environments, and fall back to ILIKE text search if no embeddings exist or vector search fails.
  - Wired automatic embedding calculation on media upload and generation.
  - Added `POST /api/media/backfill-embeddings` endpoint and backfill utility for existing rows.
  - Added test suite `backend/tests/test_semantic_search.py` verifying 384-dim dimensions, ranking of semantically-related queries without word overlap, backfill, and ILIKE fallback.
  - Verified: `pytest backend/tests/test_semantic_search.py` (5 passed in 0.81s). Commit `19ece6d`.
- **Phase 2 (AFK): #81 - Strictly validate task_type with 400 enum and disable lying Upscale button**
  - Added `ALLOWED_TASK_TYPES = frozenset({"transcode", "thumbnail", "waveform", "audio_extract"})` in `backend/app/routers/tasks.py`.
  - Rejecting any request with unknown `task_type` (including `upscale`) with HTTP 400 Bad Request and error detail containing allowed types.
  - Disabled the dead Upscale button in `frontend/src/components/FileManager.tsx` with honest tooltip `title="Upscale pipeline coming soon (pending Magnific Core map)"` and aria-disabled styling, preserving layout for the Magnific map.
  - Added regression test suite `backend/tests/test_tasks_validation.py` asserting 400 response for unknown task types and 200 for valid pipelines.
  - Verified: `pytest backend/tests/test_tasks_validation.py` (3 passed in 0.08s). Commit `e6b2fac`.

### Overall Verification:
- Backend: 185 pytest unit & integration tests passing (`pytest backend/tests/` 185 passed).
- Frontend: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (0 errors), `bun test` tunnel unit tests passing (3 passed).
